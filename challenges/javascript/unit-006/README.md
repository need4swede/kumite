Write a function that computes the factorial of a non-negative integer.

The factorial of `n` (written `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. By definition, `0!` is equal to `1`.

Return the factorial of the input number.

## Input

Input will be a non-negative integer, e.g., `5`.

## Output

Output should be a single integer representing the factorial of the input, e.g., `120`.

Write a function that converts a positive integer into its Roman numeral representation.

Roman numerals use the following symbols:

- I = 1
- V = 5
- X = 10
- L = 50
- C = 100
- D = 500
- M = 1000

The numerals are written from largest to smallest, left to right. However, there are special cases where subtraction is used:

- IV = 4 (not IIII)
- IX = 9 (not VIIII)
- XL = 40
- XC = 90
- CD = 400
- CM = 900

For example: 1994 = MCMXCIV (M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90, IV = 4)

## Input

Input will be a positive integer between 1 and 3999, e.g., `58`.

## Output

Output should be a string representing the Roman numeral, e.g., `"LVIII"`.

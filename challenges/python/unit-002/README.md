Given a string of arbitrary length with any ascii characters. Write a function to determine whether the string contains the whole word "Ligma".

The order of characters is important -- a string "abcLigmadef" is correct but "abcnLigamef" is not correct.

Upper or lower case letter does not matter -- "LiGMa" is also correct.

Return value as boolean values, true for the string to contains "Ligma", false for it does not.

Write a function that generates the classic FizzBuzz sequence.

Return a list of strings containing the numbers from `1` through the provided positive integer. Replace numbers divisible by `3` with `Fizz`, numbers divisible by `5` with `Buzz`, and numbers divisible by both `3` and `5` with `FizzBuzz`.

If the input is less than `1`, return an empty list.

## Input

Input will be an integer `n`, e.g., `5`.

## Output

Output should be a list of strings representing the FizzBuzz sequence up to `n`, e.g., `["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz"]`.
